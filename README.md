# Real-time-Insights-from-Social-Media-Data
<p>While we might not be Twitter fans, we have to admit that it has a huge influence on the world . Twitter data is not only gold in terms of insights, but <strong><em>Twitter-storms are available for analysis in near real-time</em></strong>. This means we can learn about the big waves of thoughts and moods around the world as they arise. </p>

Since our project aim is extracting insights from data,✅ Our data is ready for usage in the datasets folder — we can concentrate on exploration part
